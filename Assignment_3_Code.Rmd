This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
install.packages("DataExplorer")
```

```{r}
library(DataExplorer)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

```{r}
body_df <- read.csv("soc-redditHyperlinks-body.tsv", sep="\t", header=TRUE)
title_df <- read.csv("soc-redditHyperlinks-title.tsv", sep="\t", header=TRUE)
df <- rbind(body_df, title_df)
```

```{r}
# List of headers for the new columns extracted from PROPERTIES
headers <- read.csv("headers.csv",header=F)$V1
headers <- as.character(headers)

# Separate the PROPERTIES column by commas into the new columns and export into a new CSV file
complete_df <- separate(df, PROPERTIES, headers, sep=",")
# write.csv(complete_df,"soc-redditHyperlinks.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

```{r}
dim(complete_df)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
